## What?

Asset dashboard showing:

-   Historic bullion purchases and sales;
-   Lifetime profit / loss;
-   Current asset holdings and weightings;
-   Asset average purchase prices;

(Fake data here; real data locally.)

## Why?

### Practical React / Typescript Experience

My First React project. Nothing like a real-world project to poke holes in your theory.

Later refactored while learning Typescript.

### Personal Finances

One of many tools built over the past few years to get full transparency over my financial decisions and health.

## Shortcuts

-   Scaffolded with Create-React-App
-   Defaulted to Webpack (compiler), Babel (transpiler).
